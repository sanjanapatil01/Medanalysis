    <li>Our proposed solution addresses the challenges of avoidable hospital readmissions and suboptimal treatment plans by leveraging machine learning with Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, tailored to India’s healthcare ecosystem</li>
   <li>with Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, tailored to India’s healthcare ecosystem. The system preprocesses EHR data to ensure standardization and accuracy, enabling advanced models to identify high-risk patients and predict the likelihood of readmissions. Personalized treatment plans are dynamically generated using reinforcement learning, adapting based on patient-specific data to improve outcomes</li>
   <li>Furthermore, the system intelligently recognizes when a previously diagnosed condition is effectively managed or nearing recovery and suggests reducing doctor consultations while maintaining necessary follow-ups, thereby optimizing efficiency and patient convenience. </li>
   <li> Predictions are made transparent through explainable AI frameworks, fostering trust and aiding clinicians in decision-making. By automating repetitive tasks, the system alleviates clinician burnout, allowing them to focus on complex cases</li>
   <li>Robust security measures ensure compliance with India’s data protection regulations, such as the IT Rules, 2011, and the upcoming Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, while bias mitigation techniques promote equitable care. This innovative solution transforms EHR data into actionable insights, reducing hospital readmissions, improving recovery rates, lowering healthcare costs, and fostering a patient-centric, efficient, and sustainable healthcare system</li>
